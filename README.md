# Astrolab Play

An interactive astrolabe simulator built with Python and pygame. The app explains how a medieval astrolabe works by linking the classic 2D projection to a live 3D celestial sphere and a top-down sundial view.

## Features

### Panel 1 — 2D Astrolabe (left)
- **Tympan** (fixed plate): altitude circles (almucantars) and azimuth arcs computed for the selected latitude
- **Rete** (rotating star map): ecliptic ring with the Sun's position, 16 bright stars
- **Rule**: line from centre to the Sun, reads solar time on the hour ring
- **Hour ring** (limb): 24-hour scale around the outer rim, labelled in solar time (6 = sunrise, 12 = noon, 18 = sunset)

### Panel 2 — 3D Celestial Sphere (centre)
- Wireframe celestial sphere with equatorial grid
- **Celestial equator** (blue), **ecliptic** (red), **horizon circle** (gold)
- **Tropical band**: semi-transparent zone between the Tropic of Cancer (+23.4°) and the Tropic of Capricorn (−23.4°), subdivided by 72 RA meridian lines (every 5°, with thicker lines every 30° marking the 12 months)
- **Tangent plane**: semi-transparent horizontal plane at the observer's position
- **Sundial**: gnomon pointing to the North Celestial Pole, shadow on the horizontal plane, semi-transparent triangle connecting gnomon tip → shadow tip
- **Stereographic projection ray**: line from the South Celestial Pole through the Sun to the astrolabe plate

### Panel 3 — Sundial Top View (right)
- Orthographic top-down view of the horizontal sundial (North up, East right)
- **Daily shadow trace**: full arc from sunrise to sunset for the current date
- Hour marks (6 h – 18 h) labelled on the trace
- **Current shadow** shown as a dark line from the gnomon base to the shadow tip
- The trace shape changes with the date slider (hyperbola in winter, straight line near the equinoxes)

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| **Latitude slider** | Change observer's latitude (−89° … +89°) |
| **Date slider** | Move through the year (day 1–365) |
| **Solar time slider** | Set time of day (0 h – 24 h solar time) |
| **Drag on astrolabe** | Rotate the rete (advance / retard LST) |
| `, ` / `.` keys | Step LST back / forward 1 hour |
| `←` / `→` keys | Step date back / forward 1 day |
| `↑` / `↓` keys | Increase / decrease latitude by 1° |
| **Drag on 3D panel** | Rotate the 3D camera (azimuth / elevation) |
| `ESC` | Quit |

## Coordinate conventions

- **Stereographic projection** from the South Celestial Pole onto the equatorial plane: `r = cos(δ) / (1 + sin(δ))`
- **Hour Angle** (HA): 0 h = meridian (south), increases westward. HA = LST − RA
- **Tympan** almucantars and azimuth arcs are computed via the horizon ↔ equatorial transform for the current latitude
- **Solar time** displayed on the slider and hour ring: `solar_time = 12 + (LST − RA_sun) / 15°`
- **Shadow tip** found by ray–plane intersection: ray from gnomon tip along −sun_direction until it meets the horizontal plane (normal = zenith vector)

## Educational purpose

The three panels together answer the question *"how does a medieval astrolabe encode the 3D sky onto a flat disc?"*:

1. The **3D sphere** shows the actual geometry — the Sun on the ecliptic, the horizon tilted by latitude, the stereographic projection ray.
2. The **2D astrolabe** is the projection of that sphere: rotate the rete until the Sun sits on the horizon line to find sunrise/sunset; read the hour from the rule on the limb.
3. The **sundial** shows what an observer on the ground sees: the gnomon's shadow traces a hyperbola across the dial plate throughout the day, and its direction reads the solar hour.
